# Spark: Start easy with NextJS + PostgreSQL + Auth

Spark is a starter template using Next14 built upon a VERCEL PostgreSQL Database using Prisma ORM and no external Authentication.

## No external Authentication

Spark uses credential-based authentication that can be built open using postgresql, next14 server actions, bcrypt, and session & cookie-based auth using JWT.
